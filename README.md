**Data Filtering and Manipulation:**
- Filtered instances where the weather condition was "Fog".
- Extracted records with "Clear" weather or visibility above 40 km.
- Identified instances of "Clear" weather with relative humidity over 50% or visibility above 40 km.

**Linear Regression Model:**
- Selected features: Dew Point Temperature, Relative Humidity, Wind Speed, Visibility, and Pressure, with Temperature as the target variable.
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Trained a linear regression model on the training data.
- Evaluated model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Visualized actual vs. predicted temperature with a scatter plot.

**Insights:**
- The analysis offers insights into specific weather conditions and their corresponding features.
- The linear regression model accurately predicts temperature, demonstrated by the close alignment between actual and predicted values.

**Additional Context:**
- This analysis was completed in October 2022 as part of a Semester 2 assignment for a Master's in Data Science program.
